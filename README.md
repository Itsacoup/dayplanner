This is my Day Planner for Homework week 5.

!!! attention !!! please grade this between the hours of 9-5 for proper functionality, it uses moment.js military time for 
compare statements and does not function as intended in the evening or overnight hours. Thank you.

What was a relatively simple project, I went a little extra on and ended up creating to much work for myself and had to par it back, didnt make 
very styled or responsive but all the JS does what I inted it to. Please note you can submit up to 4 events for each time block and it will save all
the data into local storage. In order to recall it into the this hour you must refresh. Thank you for your consideration in grading.
